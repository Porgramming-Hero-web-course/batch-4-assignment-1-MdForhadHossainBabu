- In TypeScript, classes allow us to model real-world entities and encapsulate behavior. The Car class demonstrates how to define a class with properties, a constructor, and a method to calculate the car's age.

# How it's work 
- A new Car object is created with the specified make, model, and year.

- The getCarAge method returns the age of the car based on the current year.

# Conclusion
- The Car class is a simple example of how to use classes in TypeScript. It shows how to define properties, initialize them through a constructor, and create methods that operate on the data within the class. This provides a foundational structure for modeling real-world objects in TypeScript.
