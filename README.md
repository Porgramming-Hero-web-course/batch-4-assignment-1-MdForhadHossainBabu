# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript
     
   # TypeScript's union and intersection types are powerful features that allow for greater flexibility and precision when working with types. They enable developers to define more complex data structures while maintaining type safety.

   # Union Types: 

   # Union types allow you to specify that a variable or a function parameter can be one of several types. This means that the variable or parameter can be any one of the specified types.



    let value: string | number;
    value = "Hello";  // valid
    value = 10;       // valid
    value = true;     // error: 'boolean' is not assignable to 'string | number'

# Here, value can be either a string or a number, but cannot be other types such as boolean. Union types are useful when you need to work with multiple possible types.


# Use cases of Union types:
   - Function parameters: Accepting different types of input
   - Variables: A variable that can hold multiple types


# Intersection Types
   # Intersection types allow you to combine multiple types into one. The resulting type will include all the properties from the combined types.

    interface Person {
     name: string;
     age: number;
    }

    interface Employee {
    employeeId: string;
    }

     type EmployeePerson = Person & Employee;

     const employee: EmployeePerson = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    employeeId: "E123"
    };


# Here, EmployeePerson is an intersection type of Person and Employee, meaning it will have all the properties of both types.




# Use cases of Intersection types:

   - Combining multiple interfaces: When you want an object to have all the properties from multiple interfaces or types
   - Combining types into a single object type


# Summary
- Union types are used when a variable or parameter can be one of multiple types.
- Intersection types are used when you need to combine the properties of multiple types into one.
